It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing one&amp;rsquo;s current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one. Augmentation is conventionally in real-time and in semantic context with environmental elements, such as sports scores on TV during a match. With the help of advanced AR technology (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulable. Artificial information about the environment and its objects can be overlaid on the real world.",

                "description":"One of the main challenges in the clinical management of familial colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the overlap of syndromes with different underlying genetic causes and the differentiated risk management of colorectal and associated malignancies. The Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC) is characterized by the development of colorectal, endometrial, gastric and other cancers and is caused by a mutation in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) are important prognostic factors and may predict the response to chemotherapy. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) may be seen as a counterpart to Lynch syndrome, responsible for &amp;amp;lt;1% of all CRC cases. Recently the MUTYH gene has been identified as a further polyposis gene. The associated disorder has been termed MYH-associated polyposis (MAP) and displays an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. For clinical management, distinguishing between Lynch syndrome, attenuated FAP and MAP is important for risk assessment, surveillance recommendations and indication for prophylactic surgery.",

This form of cancer develops sporadically, in the setting of hereditary cancer syndromes, or on the basis of inflammatory bowel diseases. Screening and prevention programmes are available for all these causes and should be more widely publicised. The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is the basis for development of colorectal cancer, and the underlying molecular changes have largely been identified. Prognosis depends on factors related to the patient, treatment, and tumour, and the expertise of the treatment team is one of the major determinants of outcome. New information on the molecular basis of this cancer have led to the development of targeted therapeutic options, which are being tested in clinical trials. Further clinical progress will largely depend on the broader implementation of multidisciplinary treatment strategies following the principles of evidence-based medicine.",

                "description":"Colorectal cancer has been strongly associated with a Western lifestyle. In the past several decades, much has been learned about the dietary, lifestyle, and medication risk factors for this malignancy. Although there is controversy about the role of specific nutritional factors, consideration of dietary pattern as a whole appears useful for formulating recommendations. For example, several studies have shown that high intake of red and processed meats, highly refined grains and starches, and sugars is related to increased risk of colorectal cancer. Replacing these factors with poultry, fish, and plant sources as the primary source of protein; unsaturated fats as the primary source of fat; and unrefined grains, legumes and fruits as the primary source of carbohydrates is likely to lower risk of colorectal cancer. Although a role for supplements, including vitamin D, folate, and vitamin B6, remains uncertain, calcium supplementation is likely to be at least modestly beneficial. With respect to lifestyle, compelling evidence indicates that avoidance of smoking and heavy alcohol use, prevention of weight gain, and maintenance of a reasonable level of physical activity are associated with markedly lower risks of colorectal cancer. Medications such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and postmenopausal hormones for women are associated with substantial reductions in colorectal cancer risk, though their utility is affected by associated risks. Taken together, modifications in diet and lifestyle should substantially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and could complement screening in reducing colorectal cancer incidence. ?? 2010 AGA Institute.",

BACKGROUND: \nColorectal cancer is one of the most frequent malignant neoplasia in developing countries. In Mexico, is the second malignant neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract. \nMATERIAL AND METHODS: \nA literature search was performed to known the usefulness of screening, diagnosis and treatment procedures. Also, some of our actual proceedings are described. \nRESULTS: \nNo impact in decreasing the mortality rate for colorectal cancer, has been observed with the contemporary screening programs in low risk population. The recommended treatment for colorectal cancer in early stages (Dukes A and B1) is the surgical resection alone. In those patients with colon metastasizing to the lymph nodes (Dukes C), a combination of surgery + chemotherapy is recommended. In patients with rectal cancer with full penetration until the perirectal fat or with lymph node metastasis (Dukes B2 and C) a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the elective treatment. Until today, is controversial if radiotherapy should be used pre- or postoperatively. \nCONCLUSION: \nThe colorectal carcinogenesis included a multistep where are involved a tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Surgery is the accepted treatment for early colorectal cancer. A combination of surgery + chemotherapy radiotherapy is the elective treatment for locally advanced colorectal cancer.",

Incidence strongly varies globally and is closely linked to elements of a so-called western lifestyle. Incidence is higher in men than women and strongly increases with age; median age at diagnosis is about 70 years in developed countries. Despite strong hereditary components, most cases of colorectal cancer are sporadic and develop slowly over several years through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The cornerstones of therapy are surgery, neoadjuvant radiotherapy (for patients with rectal cancer), and adjuvant chemotherapy (for patients with stage III/IV and high-risk stage II colon cancer). 5-year relative survival ranges from greater than 90% in patients with stage I disease to slightly greater than 10% in patients with stage IV disease.

An additional defining characteristic of colorectal cancer is its genetic instability. Two main types of genetic instability have been identified. Microsatellite instability leads to an increased point mutation rate, whereas chromosomal instability refers to an enhanced rate of accumulating gross chromosomal aberrations. All colon cancer cell lines are genetically unstable. An interesting question is whether genetic instability arises early in tumorigenesis. An early emergence of genetic instability could drive most of the somatic evolution of cancer. Here, we review mathematical models of colorectal tumorigenesis and discuss the role of genetic instability. &amp;amp;copy; 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

                "description":"Substantial progress has been made in colorectal cancer in the past decade. Screening, used to identify individuals at an early stage, has improved outcome. There is greater understanding of the genetic basis of inherited colorectal cancer and identification of patients at risk. Optimisation of surgery for patients with localised disease has had a major effect on survival at 5 years and 10 years. For rectal cancer, identification of patients at greatest risk of local failure is important in the selection of patients for preoperative chemoradiation, a strategy proven to improve outcomes in these patients. Stringent postoperative follow-up helps the early identification of potentially radically treatable oligometastatic disease and improves long-term survival. Treatment with adjuvant fluoropyrimidine for colon and rectal cancers further improves survival, more so in stage III than in stage II disease, and oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy is now routinely used for stage III disease, although efficacy must be carefully balanced against toxicity. In stage II disease, molecular markers such as microsatellite instability might help select patients for treatment. The integration of targeted treatments with conventional cytotoxic drugs has expanded the treatment of metastatic disease resulting in incremental survival gains. However, biomarker development is essential to aid selection of patients likely to respond to therapy, thereby rationalising treatments and improving outcomes.",

However, these studies were limited because they were based on old data or examined only incidence or mortality data. In this article, the colorectal cancer burden and patterns worldwide are described using the most recently updated cancer incidence and mortality data available from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The authors provide 5-year (1998-2002), age-standardized colorectal cancer incidence rates for select cancer registries in IARC's Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, and trends in age-standardized death rates by single calendar year for select countries in the World Health Organization mortality database. In addition, available information regarding worldwide colorectal cancer screening initiatives are presented. The highest colorectal cancer incidence rates in 1998-2002 were observed in registries from North America, Oceania, and Europe, including Eastern European countries. These high rates are most likely the result of increases in risk factors associated with \"Westernization,\" such as obesity and physical inactivity. In contrast, the lowest colorectal cancer incidence rates were observed from registries in Asia, Africa, and South America. Colorectal cancer mortality rates have declined in many longstanding as well as newly economically developed countries; however, they continue to increase in some low-resource countries of South America and Eastern Europe. Various screening options for colorectal cancer are available and further international consideration of targeted screening programs and/or recommendations could help alleviate the burden of colorectal cancer worldwide.",

This article provides an overview of colorectal cancer statistics, including the most current data on incidence, survival, and mortality rates and trends. Incidence data were provided by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data were provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2014, an estimated 71,830 men and 65,000 women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 26,270 men and 24,040 women will die of the disease. Greater than one-third of all deaths (29% in men and 43% in women) will occur in individuals aged 80 years and older. There is substantial variation in tumor location by age. For example, 26% of colorectal cancers in women aged younger than 50 years occur in the proximal colon, compared with 56% of cases in women aged 80 years and older. Incidence and death rates are highest in blacks and lowest in Asians/Pacific Islanders; among males during 2006 through 2010, death rates in blacks (29.4 per 100,000 population) were more than double those in Asians/Pacific Islanders (13.1) and 50% higher than those in non-Hispanic whites (19.2). Overall, incidence rates decreased by approximately 3% per year during the past decade (2001-2010). Notably, the largest drops occurred in adults aged 65 and older. For instance, rates for tumors located in the distal colon decreased by more than 5% per year. In contrast, rates increased during this time period among adults younger than 50 years. Colorectal cancer death rates declined by approximately 2% per year during the 1990s and by approximately 3% per year during the past decade. Progress in reducing colorectal cancer death rates can be accelerated by improving access to and use of screening and standard treatment in all populations.",

In addition to colorectal neoplasia, these syndromes frequently predispose carriers to a variety of extracolonic cancers.

The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term results after intersphincteric resection in terms of the morbidity, oncologic safety, and defecatory function. METHODS: Between 1994 and 2006, 107 consecutive patients with low rectal cancer had curative intersphincteric resection, categorized as total, subtotal, or partial resection of the internal anal sphincter. RESULTS: There were no mortalities. Neorectal mucosal prolapse in patients with total intersphincteric resection and coloanal anastomotic stenosis in patients with subtotal or partial intersphincteric resection were observed as characteristic late complications. The five-year disease-free survival rates classified according to the TNM stage were 100 percent for stage I, 83.5 percent for stage II, and 72.0 percent for stage III cases. The five-year cumulative local recurrence rate after intersphincteric resection was 2.5 percent. Defecatory function, which was evaluated by bowel movement in a 24-hour period, and continence after intersphincteric resection were objectively good. The results of the multivariate analysis revealed that age was the only factor associated with a risk of fecal incontinence. CONCLUSION: Provided strict selection criteria are used, intersphincteric resection may be the optimal sphincter-preserving surgery for low rectal cancer.",

Specifically, in the application of colon cancer, a laparoscopic-assisted approach offers short-term benefits to patients while maintaining a long-term oncologic outcome. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery may help decrease operative times while preserving the benefits of laparoscopy. The literature on the use of laparoscopy for rectal cancer is still in its early stages. Limited data suggest short-term benefits without compromising oncologic outcome; however, data from large multicenter trials will clarify the role of laparoscopy in the treatment of rectal cancer. Robotic proctectomy is a novel technique that may offer considerable advantage and overcome some limitations laparoscopy creates while working in the confines of the pelvis. The improved magnification and visualization offered with the robot may also assist in preserving bladder and sexual function. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) for the treatment of T1 rectal cancers with low-risk features appears to be safe. However, TEM has a significantly higher recurrence rate when used to treat invasive cancer. Endoluminal techniques and equipment are under development and could offer more minimally invasive approaches to the treatment of colon and rectal cancer. Credentialing and training of surgeons and teams involved in the use of laparoscopy is important prior to making these techniques ubiquitous.",

A cases are those in which the growth is limited to the wall of the rectum: B cases those in which there is extrarectal spread but no lymphatic metastases; C cases those in which metastases are present in the regional lymph nodes. A striking difference is found in the operative mortality rate and in the survival period after operation in these three groups. There is reason to believe that in A cases the disease is completely eradicated by rectal excision and the excellent results of operative treatment confirms the opinion previously expressed that lymphatic metastases are not found until a rectal carcinoma has spread by direct continuity to the extrarectal tissues. A good prognosis is justified also in B cases, though slightly less favourable than in A. The results of surgical treatment in C cases are very disappointing. The scope and limitations of histological grading by Broders' method are discussed and the conclusions reached that grading of a tumour is also of value for prognosis, though not when applied to fragments removed for diagnosis.",

The aim of the study was to assess whether elective colon and rectal surgery can be safely performed without preoperative mechanical bowel preparation. \nMETHODS: \nPatients undergoing elective colon and rectal resections with primary anastomosis were prospectively randomized into two groups. Group A had mechanical bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol before surgery, and group B had their surgery without preoperative mechanical bowel preparation. Patients were followed up for 30 days for wound, anastomotic, and intra-abdominal infectious complications. \nRESULTS: \nTwo hundred forty four patients were included in the study, 120 in group A and 124 in group B. Demographic characteristics, type of surgical procedure and type of anastomosis did not significantly differ between the two groups. There was no difference in the rate of surgical infectious complications between the two groups but the overall infectious complications rate was 20.0% in group A and 11.3% in group B (p .05). Wound infection (p = 0.18), anastomotic leak (p = 0.52), and intra-abdominal abscess (p = 0.36) occurred in 9.2%, 5.8%, and 5.0% versus 4.8%, 4.0%, and 2.4%, respectively.

The aim of the study was to determine if local anesthetic blockade of peripheral visceral nociceptive input reduces both visceral and cutaneous secondary hyperalgesia in IBS patients. Ten women with IBS (mean age 30&amp;plusmn;10 years) and ten control subjects (all women) (mean age 29&amp;plusmn;7 years) rated pain intensity and unpleasantness to distension of the rectum (35 mmHg) and thermal stimulation (47&amp;deg;C) of the foot before and after rectal administration of either lidocaine jelly or saline jelly in a double blind crossover design. Intrarectal lidocaine (300 mg) reduced reported rectal and cutaneous pain in all of the IBS patients. The effects were statistically much greater than those of placebo and most of the effects were present within 5-15 min after the onset of the treatment. In the control subjects, rectal lidocaine did not decrease pain report from visceral and cutaneous stimuli. The results of this study support the hypothesis that local anesthetic blockade of peripheral impulse input from the rectum/colon reduces both visceral and cutaneous secondary hyperalgesia in IBS patients. The results provide further evidence that visceral hyperalgesia and secondary cutaneous hyperalgesia in IBS reflects central sensitization mechanisms that are dynamically maintained by tonic impulse input from the rectum/colon. Rectal administration of lidocaine jelly may also be a safe and effective means of reducing pain symptoms in IBS patients. &amp;copy; 2003 International Association for the Study of Pain.

A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase &amp;epsilon; (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.",

Methods and materials: Between 2001 and 2003, 22 patients with cancer of the cervix (1 IB1, 5 IB2, 11 IIB, 5 IIIB) were treated with computerized tomography (CT)-compatible high-dose-rate intracavitary applicators and underwent postimplant pelvic CT scans with the applicator in place. The volumes of organs at risk were digitized. For radiography-based planning, International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) bladder and rectum point doses were calculated. For the CT-based planning, the DVHs were computed for the bladder, rectum, sigmoid colon, and small bowel. To compare doses to organs at risk, the minimum dose in 2.0 cm\n                        3 volume receiving the highest dose (D\n                        2) was determined from DVHs. These D\n                        2 doses were compared with radiography-based ICRU point doses. Results: The mean ICRU bladder point dose (401 cGy) was markedly underestimated compared to the mean bladder D\n                        2 dose (484 cGy). However, the mean ICRU rectal point dose (412 cGy) did not differ significantly from the mean rectal D\n                        2 dose (373 cGy). The most frequent organ receiving the highest D\n                        2 dose was the sigmoid colon in 9 of 22 patients (41%) followed by the rectum in 7 of 22 patients (32%) and small bowel in 6 of 22 patients (27%). Conclusions: From CT-based three-dimensional (3-D) evaluation, the ICRU bladder point dose was substantially lower than bladder D\n                        2 dose. Special attention should also be given to the areas of proximal rectum and sigmoid colon due to more frequent high D\n                        2 dose in these areas. ?? 2007 American Brachytherapy Society.",

                "description":"The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory disorders of the intestine. The prevalence in the United States is greater than 200 cases per 100,000, with the total number of IBD patients between 1 and 1.5 million. CD may affect all parts of the gastrointestinal tract, from mouth to anus, but most commonly involves the distal part of the small intestine or ileum, and colon. UC results in colonic inflammation that can affect the rectum only, or can progress proximally to involve part of or the entire colon. Clinical symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and weight loss. A serious long-term complication of chronic inflammation is the development of colorectal cancer. A genetic basis for IBD had long been recognized based on the increased familial risk. However, significant discordance for CD in twins, and a much less robust phenotypic concordance for UC, suggested additional factors play a role in disease pathogenesis, including environmental factors. In the past several years, progress in understanding the molecular basis of IBD has accelerated, beginning with the generation of animal models of colitis and progressing to the identification of specific genetic markers from candidate gene, gene linkage, and genome-wide association analyses. Genetic studies have also resulted in the recognition of the importance of environmental factors, particularly the crucial role of the gut microbiota in CD and UC. Altered immune responses to the normal intestinal flora are key factors in IBD pathogenesis. In this research topic, the genetic basis of IBD, the genetic and cellular alterations associated with colitis-associated colon cancer, and the emerging role of the intestinal microbiota and other environmental factors will be reviewed.",

The National Cancer Institute sponsored a panel of experts to systematically review current literature and to draft guidelines that provide uniform definitions, principles, and practices. \nMETHODS: \nMethods were similar to those described by the American Society of Clinical Oncology in developing practice guidelines. Experts representing oncology and surgery met to review current literature on oncologic resection techniques for level of evidence (I-V, where I is the best evidence and V is the least compelling) and grade of recommendation (A-D, where A is based on the best evidence and D is based on the weakest evidence). Initial guidelines were drafted, reviewed, and accepted by consensus. \nRESULTS: \nFor the following seven factors, the level of evidence was II, III, or IV, and the findings were generally consistent (grade B): anatomic definition of colon versus rectum, tumor-node-metastasis staging, radial margins, adjuvant R0 stage, inadvertent rectal perforation, distal and proximal rectal margins, and en bloc resection of adherent tumors. For another seven factors, the level of evidence was II, III, or IV, but findings were inconsistent (grade C): laparoscopic colectomy; colon lymphadenectomy; level of proximal vessel ligation, mesorectal excision, and extended lateral pelvic lymph node dissection (all three for rectal cancer); no-touch technique; and bowel washout. For the other four factors, there was little or no systematic empirical evidence (grade D): abdominal exploration, oophorectomy, extent of colon resection, and total length of rectum resected. \nCONCLUSIONS: \nThe panel reports surgical guidelines and definitions based on the best available evidence. The availability of more standardized information in the future should allow for more grade A recommendations.",

                "description":"Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for colon and rectal cancer. Over the past several decades, there have been important advances both in the understanding of the biology of colon and rectal cancer and in the preoperative and operative techniques for treating this disease. Although it appears in some studies that we have made a difference in the survival rates in the treatment of colon and rectal cancer, in actual fact, this phenomenon may only be secondary to better staging and, therefore, a greater ability to prognosticate a particular patient's chance of cure. What has been learned in the past 20 to 30 years is that most colon and rectal carcinomas start as polyps of the colon and rectum. Most often, polyps are sporadic, but there are certain high-risk groups that produce polyps and, consequently, colon and rectal cancer at a much higher rate. The goal of a practicing physician is to identify these high-risk individuals and to recommend frequent screenings so as to intervene before a polyp has had a chance to become a deeply invasive cancer. These high-risk groups are best typified by familial adenomatous polyposis, which if left untreated will, in 100% of cases, lead to the death of a patient from colon or rectal cancer. Other diseases that lead to an increase in colon and rectal cancer but may not go through the usual adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence include inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis. Most patients with colorectal carcinoma are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. This phenomenon has led to efforts to screen the general population for polyps and for cancer. Screening techniques such as the detection of occult blood in the stool and endoscopic procedures are currently the most popular. It is unclear at this time exactly what the efficacy of these techniques is in improving the survival of the general population from colorectal carcinoma. The surgical techniques to remove colon and rectal carcinomas have recently expanded to include a more aggressive local excision policy for small tumors of the rectum and the application of laparoscopic techniques, new stapling techniques, and new anastomosing techniques for tumors of the colon and rectum. These techniques have become possible in part through advances in surgical instrumentation and also in part from our increasing understanding of the biology of the disease. Both have allowed for more creative approaches to diagnosing and treating colon and rectal cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The majority of late deaths (those occurring after five years) resulted from cancer in the descending colon, sigmoid colon or rectum rather than from cancer in the right or transverse colon. For example, among all patients with cancer of the rectum, 15.4% of those with Dukes' B tumors and 10.9% of those with Dukes' C tumors died of rectal cancer between five and ten years after diagnosis. When late survival rates were compared, patients with right and transverse colon cancer (8 deaths/93 at risk) fared significantly better than those with left colon and rectal cancer (33 deaths/171 at risk; P = 0.01). Among patients with left-sided colon and rectal carcinoma, a further significant difference in late survival was found when stage of disease was considered: patients with Dukes' A cancers (3 deaths/47 at risk after five years) fared better than those with Dukes' C cancers (21 deaths/74 at risk) (P = 0.002). For Dukes' B and C stages of disease, patients with left colon and rectal cancer fared worse than those with right and transverse colon lesions after 60 months. Of all patients who died of large bowel cancer after five years, 69% had a recurrence of cancer by 60 months, and most late recurrences were located in the descending and sigmoid colon and in the rectum. These results show differences in survival after five years with respect to both site of cancer in the colon and stage of initial disease. Our findings indicate that many left-sided large bowel cancers have a slowly progressive natural history.",

                "description":"Understanding of the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis has been gaining momentum for some years on account of its high incidence and impact on the lives of individuals affected. Different genetic abnormalities have been found in colorectal cancers from different sites. For example, proximal colon cancer is usually related to the nucleotide instability pathway, as microsatellite instability (MSI). However, distal colon cancer is usually associated with specific chromosomal instability (CIN). The development of cancer at the rectum, though similar to that at the colon, displays its own unique features. These differences might be partially attributed to different embryological development and physiological circumstances. Environmental factors such as diet and alcohol intake also differ in their role in the development of tumors in the three segments, proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum. \"Proximal shift\" of colon cancer has been known for some time, and survival rates of colorectal cancer are higher when rectal cancers are excluded, both of which emphasize the three different segments of colorectal cancer and their different properties. Meanwhile, colonic and rectal cancers are distinctive therapeutic entities. The concept of three entities of colorectal cancer may be important in designing clinical trails or therapeutic strategies. However, the dispute about the inconsistency of data concerning the site-specific mechanism of colorectal carcinoma does exist, and more evidence about molecular events of carcinogenesis and targeted therapy needs to be collected to definitely confirm the conception.",

We conducted a molecular study based on gene expression data of tumors from colon and rectum to assess the degree of similarity between these cancer sites at transcriptomic level. \nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: \nA pooled analysis of 460 colon tumors and 100 rectum tumors from four data sets belonging to three independent studies was conducted. Microsatellite instable tumors were excluded as these are known to have a different expression profile and have a preferential proximal colon location. Expression differences were assessed with linear models, and significant genes were identified using adjustment for multiple comparisons. \nRESULTS: \nMinor differences at a gene expression level were found between tumors arising in the proximal colon, distal colon, or rectum. Only several HOX genes were found to be associated with tumor location. More differences were found between proximal and distal colon than between distal colon and rectum. \nCONCLUSIONS: \nMicrosatellite stable colorectal cancers do not show major transcriptomic differences for tumors arising in the colon or rectum. The small but consistent differences observed are largely driven by the HOX genes. These results may have important implications in the design and interpretation of studies in colorectal cancer.",

Their annual incidence in the United States is rising, primarily as a result of increased incidental detection. Symptoms of rectal NETs include hematochezia, pain, and change in bowel habits. Most rectal NETs are small, submucosal in location, and associated with a very low malignant potential. Tumors larger than 2 cm or those invading the muscularis propria are associated with a significantly higher risk of metastatic spread. Colonic NETs proximal to the rectum are rarer and tend to behave more aggressively. The incidence of rectal NETs in African Americans and Asians is substantially higher than in Caucasians. Colorectal NETs are generally not associated with a hormonal syndrome such as flushing or diarrhea. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended in diagnosing and managing hindgut NETs.",

                "description":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: \nIn Japan, the incidence of colorectal cancer has increased remarkably since World War II, and interest in this cancer has grown rapidly among Japanese clinicians and pathologists. As a result, the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum started a multi-institutional registry of colorectal cancer in 1980. The purpose of this report is to present an overview of the actual state of surgical and pathologic aspects of colorectal cancer treated in the leading hospitals in Japan. \nMATERIALS AND METHODS: \nRegistry files of clinical and pathologic findings for 38,369 patients treated between 1974 and 1986 with five-year follow-up information and 26,360 patients treated between 1991 and 1994 with no follow-up information were reviewed. \nRESULTS: \nNumbers of registered patients have increased annually, reflecting a trend toward an increasing incidence of this cancer in Japan. Colon cancer increased more than rectal cancer in both genders. Resection of the primary lesion was achieved in more than 97 percent of patients who underwent surgical operation recently. The curative resection rate has improved from 65.1 to 79.1 percent for colon cancer and from 71.4 to 80.4 percent for rectal cancer between the 1974 and 1979 and the 1991 and 1994 periods, and operative mortality of those has decreased from 1.8 and 2 percent to 0.5 and 0.5 percent, respectively. There was a trend toward a decrease in locally advanced cancer in terms of cancer invasion into the bowel wall. Stage IV colon cancer also decreased from 22.9 to 16.6 percent with time. The five-year survival rate of each pTNM stage has gradually been improving and was especially evident for patients with Stages I, II, and III of rectal cancer. Overall five-year survival rates for colorectal cancer patients currently exceeds 60 percent. \n\nCONCLUSION: \nThe overall incidence of colorectal cancer and the ratio of colon cancer to rectal cancer patients in Japan are increasing. Results of surgical treatment are satisfactory with respect to curative resection rate, operative mortality, and the five-year survival rate. Registry data of the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum are useful for reporting the actual state of diagnosis, treatment, and end results of colorectal cancer in Japan.",

                "description":"Although there is considerable evidence that high consumption of red meat may increase the risk of colorectal cancer, data by subsite within the colon are sparse. The objective of our study was to prospectively examine whether the association of red meat consumption with cancer risk varies by subsite within the large bowel. We analyzed data from the Swedish Mammography Cohort of 61,433 women aged 40-75 years and free from diagnosed cancer at baseline in 1987-1990. Diet was assessed at baseline using a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire. Over a mean follow-up of 13.9 years, we identified 234 proximal colon cancers, 155 distal colon cancers and 230 rectal cancers. We observed a significant positive association between red meat consumption and risk of distal colon cancer (p for trend = 0.001) but not of cancers of the proximal colon (p for trend = 0.95) or rectum (p for trend = 0.32). The multivariate rate ratio for women who consumed 94 or more g/day of red meat compared to those who consumed less than 50 g/day was 2.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-3.68) for distal colon, 1.03 (95% CI 0.67-1.60) for proximal colon and 1.28 (95% CI 0.83-1.98) for rectum. Although there was no association between consumption of fish and risk of cancer at any subsite, poultry consumption was weakly inversely related to risk of total colorectal cancer (p for trend = 0.04). These findings suggest that high consumption of red meat may substantially increase the risk of distal colon cancer. Future investigations on red meat and colorectal cancer risk should consider cancer subsites separately.",

As a prerequisite to the determination of lifestyle attributable risks, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies to quantify gender-specific risk associated with increased leisure-time physical activity (LT-PA). METHOD: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (to December 2007), and other sources, selecting reports based on strict inclusion criteria. We used random-effects meta-analyses to estimate summary risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for uppermost vs lowermost categories of physical activity. To investigate dose-response, we explored risks ratios as a function of cumulative percentiles of physical activity distribution. RESULTS: Fifteen datasets from 14 articles, including 7873 incident cases, were identified. For colon cancer, there were inverse associations with LT-PA for men (RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.67-0.96) and women (0.86; 0.76-0.98). LT-PA did not influence risk of rectal cancer. The dose-response analysis was consistent with linear pattern reductions in risk of colon cancer in both genders. There was evidence of moderate between-study heterogeneity but summary estimates were broadly consistent across potential confounding factors. CONCLUSION: Increased LT-PA is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk; a risk reduction, which previously may have been overstated. LT-PA only interventions in public health cancer prevention strategies are unlikely to impact substantially on colorectal cancer incidences.",

As a prerequisite to the determination of lifestyle attributable risks, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies to quantify colorectal cancer risk associated with increased BMI and explore for differences by gender, sub-site and study characteristics. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (to December 2007), and other sources, selecting reports based on strict inclusion criteria. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions of study-specific incremental estimates were performed to determine the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with a 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. RESULTS: We analysed 29 datasets from 28 articles, including 67,361 incident cases. Higher BMI was associated with colon (RR 1.24, 95% CIs: 1.20-1.28) and rectal (1.09, 1.05-1.14) cancers in men, and with colon cancer (1.09, 1.04-1.12) in women. Associations were stronger in men than in women for colon (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and rectal (P = 0.005) cancers. Associations were generally consistent across geographic populations. Study characteristics and adjustments accounted for only moderate variations of associations. CONCLUSION: Increasing BMI is associated with a modest increased risk of developing colon and rectal cancers, but this modest risk may translate to large attributable proportions in high-prevalence obese populations. Inter-gender differences point to potentially important mechanistic differences, which merit further research.",

                "description":"Variation in colorectal cancer rates between countries and within ethnic groups upon migration and/or Westernization suggests a role for some aspects of Western lifestyle in the etiology of this disease. We conducted a population-based case-control study in the multiethnic population of Hawaii to evaluate associations between colorectal cancer and a number of characteristics of the Western lifestyle (high caloric intake, physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and drinking) and some of their associated diseases. We interviewed in person 698 male and 494 female United States-born or immigrant Japanese, Caucasian, Filipino, Hawaiian, and Chinese patients diagnosed in 1987-1991 with colorectal cancer and 1192 population controls matched on age, sex, and ethnicity. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios adjusting for dietary and nondietary risk factors. Place of birth and duration of residence in the United States were unrelated to colorectal cancer risk. Energy intake (independent of the calorie source) and body mass index were directly associated with risk, and lifetime recreational physical activity was inversely associated with risk. The associations with these factors were independent of each other, additive (on the logistic scale) and stronger in men. When individuals were cross-categorized in relation to the medians of these variables, those with the higher energy intake and body mass index and lower physical activity were at the highest risk (for males, OR, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-5.0, and for females, OR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.2). Smoking in the distant, as well as recent, past and alcohol use were directly associated with colorectal cancer in both sexes. Individuals with a history of diabetes or frequent constipation were at increased risk for this cancer, whereas past diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia was inversely associated with risk. The findings were consistent between sexes, among ethnic groups, and across stages at diagnosis, making bias an unlikely explanation. These results confirm the data from immigrant studies that suggest that the increase in colorectal cancer risk experienced by Asian immigrants to the United States occurred in the first generation because we found no difference in risk between the immigrants themselves and subsequent generations. They also agree with recent findings that suggest that high energy intake, large body mass, and physical inactivity independently increase risk of this disease and that a nutritional imbalance, similar to the one involved in diabetes, may lead to colorectal cancer.",

                "description":"The mechanisms by which the lifestyle risk factors obesity, physical inactivity, and low fiber intake predispose to colorectal cancer (CRC) are unclear. Chronic bowel inflammation predisposes to malignancy in cases of inflammatory bowel disease. Many lifestyle risk factors for CRC are associated with evidence of systemic inflammation as indicated by circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), but it is unknown how this relates to inflammation at tissue level. Little is known about the degree of bowel inflammation in general population and the factors that affect it. Therefore, we aimed to assess the relation of levels of bowel inflammation in the general population and lifestyle risk factors for CRC, and to additionally assess whether these associations, if present, were attenuated by controlling for evidence of systemic inflammation. Average CRC risk subjects (320) of either sex aged 50-70 were recruited in South London. A stool sample was provided for calprotectin measurement (a marker of bowel inflammation), serum for CRP, and a detailed dietary and lifestyle questionnaire completed. There was a significant positive relationship between fecal calprotectin and increasing age (P = 0.002), obesity (P = 0.04), physical inactivity (P = 0.01), and an inverse relationship with fiber intake (P = 0.02) and vegetable consumption (P = 0.04). The relationship with obesity was attenuated by controlling for serum CRP. Fecal calprotectin levels are associated with lifestyle risk factors for colorectal cancer. Low-level asymptomatic bowel inflammation may be the link between lifestyle and the pathogenesis of CRC, and circulating proinflammatory cytokines may be part of the mechanism for this link.",

                "description":"This year, more than 1 million Americans and more than 10 million people worldwide are expected to be diagnosed with cancer, a disease commonly believed to be preventable. Only 5-10% of all cancer cases can be attributed to genetic defects, whereas the remaining 90-95% have their roots in the environment and lifestyle. The lifestyle factors include cigarette smoking, diet (fried foods, red meat), alcohol, sun exposure, environmental pollutants, infections, stress, obesity, and physical inactivity. The evidence indicates that of all cancer-related deaths, almost 25-30% are due to tobacco, as many as 30-35% are linked to diet, about 15-20% are due to infections, and the remaining percentage are due to other factors like radiation, stress, physical activity, environmental pollutants etc. Therefore, cancer prevention requires smoking cessation, increased ingestion of fruits and vegetables, moderate use of alcohol, caloric restriction, exercise, avoidance of direct exposure to sunlight, minimal meat consumption, use of whole grains, use of vaccinations, and regular check-ups. In this review, we present evidence that inflammation is the link between the agents/factors that cause cancer and the agents that prevent it. In addition, we provide evidence that cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes.",

                "description":"INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is the most common tumor in the developed countries, and the number of new cases annualy is aproximately equal for men and women. Several environmental factors can interact in all steps of carcinogenesis. Lately the balance between genetic predisposition and these factors, including nutritional components and lifestyle behaviors, determines individual susceptibility to develop colorectal cancer. The aim of this study is to revise the references about lifestyle include diet, physical exercise, tobacco smoking and use of alcohol, and the risk of colorectal cancer in databases published during 1994-2004. DIETARY FACTORS: According to the reports high intake of red meat, and particularly of processed meat and positive energetic balance (high intake of total fat and carbohydrate) was associated with a moderate but significant increase in colorectal cancer risk. Convincing preventive factors include increase consumption of a wide variety of fruit and vegetable, particularly, dark-green leafy, cruciferous, a deep-yellow on tones, and fibre. LIFESTYLE: Physical activity as a means for the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. There is a probable synergic effect among physical inactivity, high energy intake and obesity and incidence of colorectal cancer. A growing body of evidence supports that avoidance overweight and the use of tobacco and alcohol is recommended to prevent colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Current data suggest that lifestyle modification including proper diet such as the ones rich in vegetable and poor in red meat and fat, regular physical activity and maintaining an appropriate body weight and avoiding the use of tobacco and alcohol may lead to reduce colorectal cancer risk.",

The authors present the first systematic comparison of risk factors by colorectal polyp type in a large colonoscopy-based case-control study of 3,764 polyp-free controls and 2,543 polyp patients, including 1,444 cases with adenomas only, 662 cases with hyperplastic polyps (HPPs) only, and 437 cases with synchronous HPPs and adenomas. Surveys were completed to obtain information on usual dietary intake and other lifestyle factors. Six lifestyle factors, including cigarette smoking, obesity, no regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, high intake of red meat, low intake of fiber, and low intake of calcium, were found to be independently associated with the risk of polyps. The risk of polyps increased progressively with an increasing number of adverse lifestyle factors. Compared with participants with no or only 1 risk factor, odds ratios for those with 5 to 6 risk factors were 2.72 (95% confidence interval: 1.94, 3.79) for adenoma only, 4.12 (95% confidence interval: 2.78, 6.09) for HPPs only, and 9.03 (95% confidence interval: 5.69, 14.34) for synchronous HPPs and adenomas. This study provides strong evidence that lifestyle modification is important for the prevention of colorectal polyps, especially advanced and multiple adenomas, which are established precursors of colorectal cancer.",

Within LS affected-families the expression of the syndrome varies, which suggests that other factors, such as lifestyle factors, have an influence on the LS phenotype. This review gives an overview of studies that assessed the role of lifestyle factors in the development of CRC in LS. Several published studies investigated smoking habits or body fatness (BMI) in relation to colorectal tumours. Those studies fairly consistently suggest that smoking and a high BMI markedly increase the risk of CRC in persons with LS. Other lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, alcohol or diet have not or only scarcely been studied. Lifestyle factors may indeed affect CRC risk in LS. However, more prospective studies with only confirmed MMR gene mutation carriers should be done to further elucidate the role of all lifestyle factors in CRC and in other types of cancer in persons with LS. Information on the role of lifestyle factors in the development of LS-associated cancers may help in establishing lifestyle and dietary recommendations with the ultimate goal of decreasing cancer risk in persons with LS.",

                "description":"Patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer and patients with small intestinal Crohn's disease are at increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma. Colorectal cancer appearing on the ground of inflammatory bowel disease is the result of a process which is believed to begin from no dysplasia progressing to indefinite dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and finally to invasive adenocarcinoma, although colorectal cancer can arise without proceeding through each of these steps. Ulcerative colitis patients with total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal-anastomosis have a rather low risk of dysplasia in the ileal pouch, although the anal transition zone should be monitored periodically, especially if chronic pouchitis is present with associated severe villous atrophy. Concerning the risk factors predisposing to colorectal cancer in the setting of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, it seems that the risk increases with longer duration and greater anatomic extent of colitis, the degree of inflammation, and the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis and family history of colorectal cancer. Concerning the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, it is now well established that the molecular alterations responsible for sporadic colorectal cancer, namely chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability and hypermethylation, also play a role in colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis. Chemoprevention strategies include the administration of agents such as aminosalicylates, ursodeoxycholic acid, and possibly folic acid and statins, the exact role of which remains to be further elucitated.",

                "description":"INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES (IBDS) CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO MAJOR DISORDERS: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although IBD-associated colorectal cancer (IBD-CRC) accounts for only 1-2% of all cases of colorectal cancer, IBD with colon involvement is among the top three high-risk conditions for colorectal cancer. Today, colorectal cancer accounts for approximately 10-15% of all deaths among IBD patients. Indeed, patients with IBD colitis are six times more likely to develop colorectal cancer than the general population and have a higher frequency of multiple synchronous colorectal cancers. Since IBD-CRC was first described in 1925, the colon remains the primary site of neoplasms in IBD patients today. Ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer is most common in the rectum and sigmoid colon, whereas Crohn's disease-associated colorectal cancer is evenly distributed between the different colon segments. Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer remains an important goal, and colonoscopy surveillance programs are critical to early detection in these patients. Newer methods, such as chromoendoscopy, are currently being investigated as complementary techniques to enhance early detection of dysplasia and cancer in this high-risk population. We present a comprehensive review of the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Major themes covered include risk factors for IBD-CRC and the molecular pathobiology of progression from dysplasia to cancer, endoscopic surveillance and new methods for early detection of dysplasia, approaches to prevention of IBD-CRC, and current recommendations and controversies regarding the treatment of dysplasia. In particular, disagreement has arisen over optimal management of low-grade dysplasia, with some IBD experts now advocating close colonoscopic surveillance of patients with low-grade dysplasia rather then total colectomy.",

                "description":"The risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is influenced by several acquired risk factors, including environmental exposures and comorbid medical conditions that are partially genetic in nature. These risk factors are based on data almost exclusively derived from observational studies. Because of the possibility of bias due to confounding, these acquired risk factors should not be automatically assumed to be causative, and in fact some may not be truly independent risk factors. Acquired risk factors include the following categories: 1) dietary factors, 2) lifestyle factors, 3) side-effects of medical interventions, and 4) comorbid medical conditions. Dietary factors that potentially increase the risk of CRC include low fruit, vegetable, or fiber intake, high red meat or saturated fat consumption, and exposure to caffeine or alcohol. Of these factors, the significance of low fruit, vegetable, and fiber intake has been called into question because of contradictory results from large observational studies and negative results from randomized trials. The association of high red meat or saturated fat consumption with increased CRC risk is supported by the preponderance of observational data. Lifestyle factors include lack of exercise and smoking. These risk factors are supported by observational data of moderate quality. Medical interventions that may increase the risk of CRC include pelvic irradiation, cholecystectomy, and ureterocolic anastomosis after major surgery of the urinary and intestinal tracts. Aside from cholecystectomy, these risk factors are supported by observational data from small studies only, therefore their validity is not well established. Finally, comorbid medical conditions that are associated with increased risk of CRC include Barrett's esophagus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, acromegaly, and inflammatory bowel disease. The association between inflammatory bowel disease and CRC is well established and it forms the basis for widely adopted colonoscopic surveillance recommendations from national medical organizations. The other factors are supported by limited observational data only and are still controversial.",

In this population-based study we describe changes in colorectal cancer incidence in Singapore and explore the reasons behind these changes through age-period cohort (APC) modeling. METHODS: We included all 22,609 colorectal cancer cases reported to the Singapore Cancer Registry between 1968 and 2002. Poisson regression, using age-period (AP) and age-cohort (AC) models was used to determine the effects of age at diagnosis, calendar period, and birth cohort. RESULTS: Male colorectal cancer rates between 1968 and 2002 from 20 to 40 per 100,000 person years. The increase was sharpest among older men, for whom there was a significant AC effect. Female colorectal cancer rates increased until 1992 (from 16 to 29 per 100,000 person years) and stabilized afterward. For women under 65 years, we observed a significant AP effect, corresponding to a sudden rise in colorectal cancer incidence around 1978. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates important gender differences in colorectal cancer incidence in Singapore, with increasing rates among men, and stabilized rates in women. The increase in men is mainly attributable to an incidence increase in the oldest age groups, probably due to increased exposure to dietary and lifestyle risk factors earlier in life. The stabilization in female colorectal cancer risk could be due to lower exposure to lifestyle risk factors and prophylactic removal of precancerous lesions.",

                "description":"BACKGROUND: \nMultidisciplinary attempts to understand the etiology of breast cancer are expanding to increasingly include new potential markers of disease risk. Those efforts may have maximal scientific and practical influence if new findings are placed in context of the well-understood lifestyle and reproductive risk factors or existing risk prediction models for breast cancer. We therefore evaluated known risk factors for breast cancer in a cancer screening trial that does not have breast cancer as a study endpoint but is large enough to provide numerous analytic opportunities for breast cancer. \nMETHODS: \nWe evaluated risk factors for breast cancer (N = 2085) among 70,575 women who were randomized in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Using Poisson regression, we calculated adjusted relative risks [RRs, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for lifestyle and reproductive factors during an average of 5 years of follow-up from date of randomization. \nRESULTS: \nAs expected, increasing age, nulliparity, positive family history of breast cancer, and use of menopausal hormone therapy were positively associated with breast cancer. Later age at menarche (16 years or older vs. &amp;lt; 12: RR = 0.81, 95% CI, 0.65-1.02) or menopause (55 years or older vs. &amp;lt; 45: RR = 1.29, 95% CI, 1.03-1.62) were less strongly associated with breast cancer than was expected. There were weak positive associations between taller height and heavier weight, and only severe obesity [body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)) 35 or more vs. 18.5-24.9: RR = 1.21, 95% CI, 1.02-1.43] was statistically significantly associated with breast cancer. \nCONCLUSION: \nThe ongoing PLCO trial offers continued opportunities for new breast cancer investigations, but these analyses suggest that the associations between breast cancer and age at menarche, age at menopause, and obesity might be changing as the underlying demographics of these factors change.

                "description":"Several studies indicate that Western dietary and lifestyle factors are responsible for the high incidence of colorectal cancer in industrialized countries. Diets rich in red and processed meat, refined starches, sugar, and saturated and trans-fatty acids but poor in fruits, vegetables, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids and whole grains are closely associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Other main features of the western lifestyle, such as excess body mass and sedentary behaviours, are also strongly associated with higher risk of developing this cancer. Modifications of the western diet, notably increasing consumption of foods from plant origin and reducing that of red meat intake, and maintenance of physical activity and appropriate body mass could substantially reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.",

                "description":"PURPOSE: Lifestyle factors and environmental exposures might help explain the risk of colorectal carcinoma in countries where the incidence is low, but unique patterns of young onset and a high proportion of rectal cancer exist. METHODS: We obtained detailed lifestyle information from 421 patients with colorectal cancer and 439 hospital-controls in Egypt. Logistic regression models were computed to evaluate the risk factors of colorectal carcinoma. RESULTS: A history of pesticide exposure and more frequently eating food directly from farms were significantly associated with a higher risk of colorectal carcinoma (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.1-5.9, and odds ratio = 4.6; 95% CI = 1.5-14.6, respectively). Parous women who reported 7 or more live births or breastfed for 19 months or longer per live birth had a significantly lower risk for colorectal carcinoma (odds ratio = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.2-0.7, and odds ratio = 0.2; 95% CI = 0.1-0.4, respectively). Compared with patients aged 40 years or older, industrial exposures were more common in younger patients (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Agricultural and industrial exposures were associated with increased risk of colorectal carcinoma, whereas prolonged lactation and increased parity were inversely associated with colorectal carcinoma in women. Further research to elucidate the biological role of intense environmental and industrial exposures and reproductive factors including lactation may further clarify the etiology of colorectal cancer.",

The purpose of this review was to undertake a comparison of the strength of the associations between known and putative risk factors for colorectal cancer by conducting 10 independent meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies. Studies published between 1966 and January 2008 were identified through EMBASE and MEDLINE, using a combined text word and MESH heading search strategy. Studies were eligible if they reported estimates of the relative risk for colorectal cancer with any of the following: alcohol, smoking, diabetes, physical activity, meat, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables. Studies were excluded if the estimates were not adjusted at least for age. Overall, data from 103 cohort studies were included. The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly associated with alcohol: individuals consuming the most alcohol had 60% greater risk of colorectal cancer compared with non- or light drinkers (relative risk 1.56, 95% CI 1.42-1.70). Smoking, diabetes, obesity and high meat intakes were each associated with a significant 20% increased risk of colorectal cancer (compared with individuals in the lowest categories for each) with little evidence of between-study heterogeneity or publication bias. Physical activity was protective against colorectal cancer. Public-health strategies that promote modest alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, weight loss, increased physical activity and moderate consumption of red and processed meat are likely to have significant benefits at the population level for reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer.",

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Hospitals of the Department of Veterans Affairs. PATIENTS: 8722 and 7629 case-patients with colon and rectal cancer, respectively, and age-, sex-, race-matched controls who were discharged at the same time as the corresponding case-patients. MEASUREMENTS: Number and type of endoscopic procedures of the large bowel done from 1981 until the development of colorectal cancer in each case-patient. The influence of endoscopic procedures on the development of colorectal cancer was tested by conditional multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with colorectal cancer were less likely to have had an endoscopic procedure of the large bowel before being diagnosed with cancer (odds ratio for colon cancer, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.58]; odds ratio for rectal cancer, 0.55 [CI, 0.47 to 0.64]). In patients who had flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and polypectomy, the odds ratios were even smaller. When analyzed by separate 1-year intervals, patients with cancer had significantly fewer procedures during periods of up to 6 years before their onset of their cancer. Similarly, fewer inpatient and outpatient procedures were done in patients than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic procedures of the large bowel reduce the risk for developing colon and rectal cancer by 50%, their protective influence lasting 6 years.",

In a population-based case control study conducted in Germany, 540 cases with a first diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer and 614 controls matched for age, sex, and county of residence were recruited. A detailed lifetime history of endoscopic examinations of the large bowel was obtained by standardized personal interviews, validated by medical records, and compared between cases and controls, paying particular attention to location of colorectal cancer and sex differences. Overall, 39%, 77%, and 64% of proximal, distal, and total colorectal cancer cases were estimated to be preventable by colonoscopy. The estimated proportion of total colorectal cancer cases preventable by sigmoidoscopy was 45% among both women and men, assuming that sigmoidoscopy reaches the junction of the descending and sigmoid colon only and findings of distal polyps are not followed by colonoscopy. Assuming that sigmoidoscopy reaches the splenic flexure and colonoscopy is done after detection of distal polyps, estimated proportions of total colorectal cancer preventable by sigmoidoscopy increase to 50% and 55% (73% and 91% of total colorectal cancer preventable by primary colonoscopy) among women and men, respectively. We conclude that colonoscopy provides strong protection against colorectal cancer among both women and men. The proportion of this protection achieved by sigmoidoscopy with follow-up colonoscopy in case of distal polyps may be larger than anticipated. Among men, this regimen may be almost as effective as colonoscopy, at least at previous performance levels of colonoscopy.",

The aim was to estimate how frequently lower GI endoscopy might have failed to detect cancer during the 5 years preceding a final diagnosis of CRC. Methods 273 patients were identified from cancer registry with CRC from April 2007 to March 2009. Records were reviewed for the results of colonoscopy and fl exible sigmoidoscopy 6 months to 5 years prior to their diagnosis of cancer. Results Among the 273 patients, we identified 10 patients (3.7%) who had colonoscopy and /or fl exible sigmoidoscopy that had not shown CRC prior to the final diagnosis. In the missed cancer group three cases were incomplete and eight were false negative with a median diagnostic delay of 36 months (range 12-60). 70% of the missed cancer group were diagnosed with Dukes' C colon cancer and 30% presented with emergency complications. Conclusion A recent study by Bressler et al suggested that up to 4% of cancers may be missed at colonoscopy. Our miss rates are in line with previous studies. The reasons why cancers were missed relate to incomplete colonoscopy, poor bowel preparation, inadequate technique, prior incomplete polypectomy, failure to recognise fl at lesions, misinterpretation of what was seen and failure to arrange alternative tests in patients with incomplete tests.",

Sigmoidoscopy's benefit is limited to the distal colon. Observational data are conflicting regarding the degree to which colonoscopy affords protection against proximal CRC. Our aim was to explore the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy vs. sigmoidoscopy and alternative CRC screening strategies in light of the latest published data. METHODS: We performed a contemporary cost-utility analysis using a Markov model validated against data from randomized controlled trials of FOBT and sigmoidoscopy. Persons at average CRC risk within the general US population were modeled. Screening strategies included those recommended by the United States (US) Preventive Services Task Force, including colonoscopy every 10 years (COLO), flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years (FS), annual fecal occult blood testing, annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), and the combination FS/FIT. The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. RESULTS: In the base case, FIT dominated other strategies. The advantage of FIT over FS and COLO was contingent on rates of uptake and adherence that are well above current US rates. Compared with FIT, FS and COLO both cost &lt;$50,000/QALY gained when FIT per-cycle adherence was &lt;50%. COLO cost $56,800/QALY gained vs. FS in the base case. COLO cost &lt;$100,000/QALY gained vs. FS when COLO yielded a relative risk of proximal CRC of &lt;0.5 vs. no screening. In probabilistic analyses, COLO was cost-effective vs. FS at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY gained in 84% of iterations. CONCLUSIONS: Screening colonoscopy may be cost-effective compared with FIT and sigmoidoscopy, depending on the relative rates of screening uptake and adherence and the protective benefit of colonoscopy in the proximal colon. Colonoscopy's cost-effectiveness compared with sigmoidoscopy is contingent on the ability to deliver ~50% protection against CRC in the proximal colon.",

Endoscopy could promote suture breakdown at sites of colonic anastomoses, ostia, or repair by colonic abrasion or stretch from endoscopic intubation, torque, and insufflation. METHODS: Risks versus benefits of lower endoscopy performed within 3 wk of colonic surgery were retrospectively analyzed at five medical centers in 36 patients undergoing sigmoidoscopy and 72 age-and-sex-matched controls, and in 16 patients undergoing colonoscopy and 32 age-and-sex-matched controls. RESULTS: Sigmoidoscopy indications included rectal bleeding in 14, distal colonic obstruction in 12, and other in 10. Sigmoidoscopy provided the diagnosis in 18 (54%) of 33 cases (excluding three therapeutic sigmoidoscopies, control rate = 30%, p &lt; 0.01, X2, including colon cancer in six and benign stricture in five. Sigmoidoscopy led to colonic surgery in nine and medical therapy changes in four. Colonoscopy indications included colonic bleeding in seven, colonic obstruction in five, and other in four. Colonoscopy provided the diagnosis in nine (56%, control rate = 56%, NS, X2). Colonoscopy led to colonic surgery in three and chemotherapy in one. Two endoscopic complications, unrelated to suture breakdown, occurred: An acutely ill patient developed hypotension during sigmoidoscopy which resolved with intravenous fluid resuscitation. A contained sigmoid diverticular perforation became a free perforation (requiring laparotomy) after colonoscopy. Both control groups had no endoscopic complications (NS, Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSION: In this study, the benefits outweighed the risks of postoperative sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. Clinicians should use discretion and perform colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy after colonic surgery, particularly bowel anastomosis, only for clinically important indications. Endoscopy is contraindicated when colonic wound dehiscence or bowel perforation is suspected.",

We tested the hypothesis that only one flexible sigmoidoscopy screening between 55 and 64 years of age can substantially reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. METHODS: This randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 14 UK centres. 170 432 eligible men and women, who had indicated on a previous questionnaire that they would accept an invitation for screening, were randomly allocated to the intervention group (offered flexible sigmoidoscopy screening) or the control group (not contacted). Randomisation by sequential number generation was done centrally in blocks of 12, with stratification by trial centre, general practice, and household type. The primary outcomes were the incidence of colorectal cancer, including prevalent cases detected at screening, and mortality from colorectal cancer. Analyses were intention to treat and per protocol. The trial is registered, number ISRCTN28352761. FINDINGS: 113 195 people were assigned to the control group and 57 237 to the intervention group, of whom 112 939 and 57 099, respectively, were included in the final analyses. 40 674 (71%) people underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy. During screening and median follow-up of 11.2 years (IQR 10.7-11.9), 2524 participants were diagnosed with colorectal cancer (1818 in control group vs 706 in intervention group) and 20 543 died (13 768 vs 6775; 727 certified from colorectal cancer [538 vs 189]). In intention-to-treat analyses, colorectal cancer incidence in the intervention group was reduced by 23% (hazard ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.70-0.84) and mortality by 31% (0.69, 0.59-0.82). In per-protocol analyses, adjusting for self-selection bias in the intervention group, incidence of colorectal cancer in people attending screening was reduced by 33% (0.67, 0.60-0.76) and mortality by 43% (0.57, 0.45-0.72). Incidence of distal colorectal cancer (rectum and sigmoid colon) was reduced by 50% (0.50, 0.42-0.59; secondary outcome). The numbers needed to be screened to prevent one colorectal cancer diagnosis or death, by the end of the study period, were 191 (95% CI 145-277) and 489 (343-852), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a safe and practical test and, when offered only once between ages 55 and 64 years, confers a substantial and longlasting benefit.

                "description":"BACKGROUND: \nCurrent guidelines recommend computed tomography (CT) for diagnosing diverticulitis and for routine follow-up colonoscopy to rule out cancer. Scientific data to support routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis are scarce and conflicting. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of colon cancer mimicking diverticulitis, and hence the need for routine colonoscopy after CT-diagnosed acute diverticulitis.\nMETHODS: \nThis study was a retrospective analysis of patients treated for acute diverticulitis in a single academic institution during 2006-2010. Data regarding age, sex, laboratory parameters, prior diverticulitis, surgical operations, pathology reports, and CT characteristics were collected. Risk factors for finding colon cancer after CT-diagnosed acute diverticulitis were identified by multivariate analysis.\nRESULTS: \nThe study enrolled 633 patients with CT-diagnosed acute diverticulitis. Of these patients, 97 underwent emergency resection, whereas 536 were treated conservatively, 394 of whom underwent colonoscopy. The findings showed 17 cancers (2.7 %) in patients with an initial diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. As shown by CT, 16 cancer patients (94 %) had abscess, whereas one patient had pericolic extraluminal air but no abscess. Of the patients with abscess, 11.4 % had cancer mimicking acute diverticulitis. No cancer was found in the patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Besides abscess, other independent risk factors for cancer included suspicion of cancer by a radiologist, thickness of the bowel wall exceeding 15 mm, no diverticula observed, and previously undiagnosed metastases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Routine colonoscopy after CT-proven uncomplicated diverticulitis seems to be unnecessary, but colonoscopy should be performed for patients with a diagnosis of diverticular abscess.",
